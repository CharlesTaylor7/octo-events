## Tech Stack Choices

Out of the gate I determined I wanted to use Node.js, Typescript & Postgres.
For the API layer I reached for Express.js for familiarity.
I determined I would also like an ORM & DB migration tool so the app could evolve over time easily with new requirements.

I performed some google searches to find an initial list of 5 ORMS with typescript support. I arrived at the following list of ORMs and which I researched:
- Objection + knex
- MikroORM
- Sequelize
- Prisma
- TypeOrm

Decided to use TBD.
